welcome to this repository. this is a general archive of my earliest attempts at software development, spanning across my childhood and early teenage years dating back from 2013-2014.

please read this before diving into the code:

> [!NOTE]
> i am uploading these files exactly as they were originally created. i have purposely chosen not to fix any bugs, correct typos, or update the formatting. this is to preserve the original "date modified" timestamps and keep the archive completely authentic.

> [!NOTE]
> when these projects were made, i was a kid with zero industry knowledge and absolutely no real world experience. i was just experimenting blindly to see what worked.

> [!NOTE]
>  if you look at the source code, you will find a lack of comments, bizzare naming conventions, and logic that makes absolutely no sense. this was before i formally learned programming concepts, so expect pure trial and error.

> [!NOTE]
> you might find detailed user interfaces with buttons and menus that lead nowhere. i was designing complex layouts before i actually knew how to code the functionality behind them. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> you will likely find projects labeled as "open source" that i attempted to sell, or "libre" software that bizarrely requires product activation codes. you might also see highly unusual terms and conditions, fake corporate entities (like "libre software and development,. inc."), and copy-pasted wikipedia articles in the acknowledgements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> there are claims in my old text files stating that brands and software names were "soughted and cleared out." they absolutely were not. i had a habit of pretending i had a corporate legal team.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> any demanding language, weird copyright claims, or attempts to monetise free concepts were purely the result of a kid playing pretend ceo and trying to mimic professional software development environments. none of these old terms and conditions are active or enforced, and no offense or harm was ever intended.

i am sharing these projects purely for preservation's sake and to document my journey as a developer. it shows where i started before i actually learned how the industry works. feel free to explore, and please excuse the absolute mess.
